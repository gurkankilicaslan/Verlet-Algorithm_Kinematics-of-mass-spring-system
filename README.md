# Verlet-Algorithm_Kinematics-of-mass-spring-system

Multiple mass-spring systems are used in most of engineering modeling and solving many engineering
problems. A system consisting of masses connected to each other with springs is a classical system
with different degrees of freedom. For example, a system consisting of three masses and two springs
connecting the masses has 3 degrees of freedom. This shows that the configuration of the system can
be defined with 3 different generalized coordinates which are the position vectors of the masses(ùë•1,
ùë•2, ùë•3). The motions of the masses can be described with 3 different second degree differential
equations. In the simplest form of this configuration, external factors such as friction force and air
resistance can be ignored, and only eleastic forces based on Hooke's Law can be considered. In
general, the character of the movement can be determined by 3 different eigenfrequencies based on
system parameters, masses and spring constants. Also, the movements of the masses are strongly
dependent on their initial positions and initial velocities. So far, one solution to this type of system
was considered but there is another useful solution using Verlet Algorithm. Both solution will give a
harmonic response since springs are such tools trying to reach their equilibrium positions, doing so,
they also overshoot and undershoot equilibrium positions since there were initial inputs preventing
the system from re-reaching its equilibrium. In this paper, the nature of the multiple mass-spring
system is considered by using 2 different methods and investigating position-time and velocity-time
relations.
